Running a QEMU Windows VM on GitpodThis project contains a configuration (.gitpod.yml) and a script (rdp-setup.sh) that attempt to download and run a Windows Server 2012 R2 virtual machine using QEMU inside a Gitpod workspace.!!! CRITICAL WARNINGS !!!Please read these warnings carefully before proceeding. Running this script is extremely risky and very unlikely to work.1. MAJOR SECURITY RISKYou are downloading a pre-built Windows disk image (.gz) and an ngrok setup script from un-audited, non-official sources (a URL shortener and a personal hosting link).These files could contain malware, ransomware, keyloggers, or backdoors.The credentials provided (Administrator / Lingg@H0sting) are public and the VM, if it ever runs, will be exposed to the internet via ngrok.DO NOT enter any personal or sensitive information into this VM.Run this entirely at your own risk.2. Nested Virtualization (Likely to Fail)Gitpod workspaces are Linux containers, not full virtual machines. Running a VM (QEMU) inside a container requires "nested virtualization," which is disabled by default on almost all cloud platforms for security and performance reasons.The script will most likely fail to run the qemu-system-x86_64 command. If it does run (using slow software emulation), it will be unbelievably slow and completely unusable.3. Resource Limits (Likely to Fail)The script attempts to allocate 8GB of RAM (-m 8G) and 40 CPU cores (-smp cores=40). A standard Gitpod workspace does not have these resources. The Gitpod platform will almost certainly kill the process for exceeding memory and CPU limits, causing the script to fail.4. Gitpod Terms of ServiceUsing a Gitpod workspace for non-development activities, crypto-mining, or running server-style VMs (especially from unofficial sources) may violate Gitpod's Terms of Service and could lead to your account being suspended.How to Try (At Your Own Risk)Create a new, empty repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.Add the .gitpod.yml and rdp-setup.sh files from this document to your repository.Commit and push the files.Open your repository in Gitpod by prefixing the URL (e.g., gitpod.io/#https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name).The  file will be detected, and the terminal will automatically start running the rdp-setup.sh script.You will be prompted to choose an ngrok region.
